      "tools": ["Notion", "Notion Automations", "Buttons", "Relations", "Timeline Views"],
      "impact": {
        "primary": "Reduced intake-to-handoff time by 80-90% (from 3-5 minutes to 15-30 seconds)",
        "metrics": [
          "Cut manual fields per intake by 70% (from 8-12 to 2-3)",

      "overview": {
        "problem": "Project intake, assignment, and milestone tracking required repetitive manual edits and copy-paste across multiple pages, leading to inconsistent data and missed follow-ups.",
        "solution": "Built from scratch a custom Notion PM system with status-driven automations: intake triage, PM assignment, auto-date stamping on milestones, auto-creation of tasks and checkpoint records, and one-click duplication of awarded retrofit leads into the Projects DB.",
        "outcome": "Faster handoffs, standardized schema for reporting, and reliable accountability via automatic notifications and timeline-based visibility. Now managing 40+ projects seamlessly."

        "outcome": "Eliminated hours of weekly manual data entry, consistent cross-system data quality, and real-time portfolio dashboards powered by automated synchronization."

        "outcome": "Orders-of-magnitude faster processing (14 seconds vs 2.5 hours) with documented, repeatable reconciliation. Runs daily Mon-Fri, saving 300+ hours annually."
