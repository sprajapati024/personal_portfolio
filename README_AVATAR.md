# How to Add Your Avatar

Your avatar image should be placed at:
```
public/avatar.png
```

## Steps:
1. Download/save your Notion avatar image (the one with glasses and beard you showed in the chat)
2. Rename it to `avatar.png`
3. Place it in the `public/` folder (replacing the current placeholder)

The AboutWindow component is already configured to display it!

Current path: `c:/Users/sprajapati/Personal_Portfolio/public/avatar.png`
